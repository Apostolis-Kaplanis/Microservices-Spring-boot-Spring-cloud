Currency Exchange Service
http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

Currency Conversion Service
http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

If i want to have 2 instances of this application running:
Run Configurations -> 
(right-click)-> Duplicate ->
change name (CurrencyExchangeServiceApplication8000) -> CurrencyExchangeServiceApplication8001 ->
Arguments tab -> 
at VM Arguments, type -Dserver.port=8001 (This will override whatever is configured in application.properties)
(now i can check 
http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
and 
http://localhost:8001/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR)
