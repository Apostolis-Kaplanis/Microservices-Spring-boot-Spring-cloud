Until now we have:

1. Currency Exchange microservice
http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

2. Currency Conversion microservice
http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

3. Eureka
http://localhost:8761

And now,
4. API GATEWAY
http://localhost:8765

_____________________________________________________________________
Api Gateway should talk to Any Microservice (registered with Eureka):
_____________________________________________________________________
We want the Api Gateway to talk to Eureka with that name (CURRENCY-EXCHANGE), find the microservice-server LOCATION,
	and then execute requests to that url (currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR)
([From Eureka,] we pick up the NAME of the wanted microservice (CURRENCY-EXCHANGE), 
	and picking up the PATH to that microservice (/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR) ).

Via the Api Gateway:
	http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR -> Whitelabel Error Page 404
Solution:
We Enable DISCOVERY LOCATOR that in application.properties file:
	spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true
	
	
So now all my microservices URLS will be like:
http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
With LOWERCASE enabled: 
(spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId=true)
http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

Best practice however is to create CUSTOM ROUTES. (custom configuration class: ApiGatewayConfiguration)
http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
and also create new urls there, like:
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-new/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
